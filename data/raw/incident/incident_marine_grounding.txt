Synthetic Marine Incident Report – Engine Failure and Grounding

(fully synthetic narrative created for training and GenAI extraction testing; not based on any real casualty report)

The incident occurred sometime during the early hours of a late autumn morning, though the exact time is unclear because different crew members gave different accounts when interviewed later. According to one of the deckhands, the vessel began experiencing irregular vibrations shortly after departing the outer anchorage. Another crew member claimed the vibrations had been present even before departure but were dismissed as “normal engine noise” due to cold weather. Engine room logs were partially completed but the entries around the time of the event appear inconsistent, with one log showing a spike in exhaust temperature while another line for the same time period is left blank.

Weather conditions were described as “rough but manageable,” although the wind speed reported by the master in the initial statement does not match the figure mentioned in the port authority’s communication. Sea state was reported as around two to three metres by one source and closer to four by another. The vessel was following what was believed to be the standard outbound route, but the electronic chart screenshot that was provided later shows a slight deviation to the north, possibly due to traffic avoidance or miscommunication between the bridge team and the lookout. There was also a brief mention of radar clutter caused by rain, though there is no clear evidence this affected decision making.

The main engine reportedly shut down without warning. One engineer stated that there was a low lube oil pressure alarm before shutdown, but the chief engineer said no such alarm appeared on the panel at that time. The emergency alarm loggers have conflicting timestamps, and some alarms were overwritten due to limited storage. Attempts were made to restart the engine but the crew could not restore propulsion. The auxiliary engine was running but did not provide enough power to hold position against the increasing swell.

The vessel began to drift towards a rocky shoreline. Several attempts were made to drop anchor, but the anchor reportedly did not hold. One crew member stated that the anchor chain may have been fouled or not fully deployed, but another said the windlass was functioning normally. Meanwhile communications with the coast radio station were intermittent, and messages appear to have been sent both by VHF and mobile phone with varying levels of clarity. It is unclear when the first request for assistance was formally logged.

Within less than an hour of losing propulsion, the vessel made contact with the seabed. The first impact was described by one person as “a light scraping,” but others reported a “heavy jolt” that caused several objects to fall inside the galley area. A small breach occurred in the forward keel area, though internal statements differ on whether the breach happened on first contact or after several additional groundings as the vessel pivoted in the swell. Flooding in the forward compartment was initially believed to be minor, but a later inspection suggested the water ingress may have been greater than first reported.

Emergency teams arrived after the grounding, but the exact sequence of events remains unclear. Some crew members were evacuated to shore for medical checks, though no serious injuries were reported. The engine room remained inaccessible for part of the response due to water accumulation near electrical cabinets. Divers inspected the hull later in the day and found scoring and deformation along the forward section.

There were references in the crew interviews to maintenance issues that had been raised previously but not fully addressed. One engineer mentioned that the lube oil filtration unit had shown signs of clogging in the months leading up to the incident, but maintenance logs do not include any record of the filter being replaced. Another statement said the vibration noticed before the incident might have been linked to a known issue with one of the fuel injectors, but this was not formally recorded. There were also inconsistent comments about whether voyage planning had been completed in line with company procedures, particularly regarding weather routing.

Environmental impact was believed to be limited, although a small sheen was observed near the grounding site. Local authorities requested monitoring until the vessel was refloated and towed to a repair facility. Early internal reports suggested the incident may have been preventable if clearer alarm records had been maintained and if earlier signs of machinery issues had been escalated.
