The property insurance described here applies to a dwelling used primarily as the policyholder’s main residence, although some editions of the policy have accepted seasonal or occasional second home use provided that the insurer was told beforehand. The structure itself is insured for damage from a broad range of causes except those specifically excluded, but the list of exclusions and limitations has changed over time. Some homeowners assume all damage is covered simply because they have “full coverage,” but this term does not appear anywhere in the formal policy and has led to misunderstandings when losses arise from situations like long term water seepage, wear and tear, or unreported renovations. The insurer may also require confirmation that the property was occupied at the time of the loss or that reasonable care was taken to prevent further damage after the event.

Coverage for the dwelling includes the main building, attached structures, and certain permanently installed fixtures. What counts as permanently installed has caused some debate in past claims, particularly where improvements were made by previous owners without documentation. Detached structures such as sheds, fences, and garages may also be covered under a separate limit, though policyholders sometimes assume these limits match the dwelling amount, which is rarely correct. Calculations for replacement cost depend on local construction prices, materials, and building codes, yet homeowners often underestimate how these factors change over time, leading to coverage gaps unless they review the limits regularly.

Personal property belonging to the insured is protected against losses from specified perils such as fire, theft, smoke, and windstorm, but the definition of theft varies across policy versions. For example, mysterious disappearance is not considered theft in many editions unless there is evidence of forced entry, which can be difficult to prove if an item was simply misplaced or lost. Certain categories of valuables like jewellery, fine art, collectibles, and electronic equipment may have lower sublimits unless additional coverage was purchased. There have been cases where individuals stored expensive items in outbuildings believing they were fully covered, only to discover the outbuilding limit applied instead of the main personal property limit.

Loss of use coverage may reimburse living expenses if the home becomes uninhabitable after an insured event. However, what qualifies as uninhabitable is not always clear, especially when utilities are partially functional or only certain rooms are affected. Expenses must be reasonable and necessary, but receipts are required and delays in sending documentation can slow down reimbursement. Some policyholders try to claim upgrades or discretionary costs that do not relate to temporary living arrangements, leading to disputes over what is considered appropriate under this coverage.

Liability protection applies when a claim or lawsuit is brought against the insured due to bodily injury or property damage to others, but the insurer must first determine whether the insured was legally responsible. This often requires statements from witnesses, repair estimates, and sometimes legal review. Exclusions exist for incidents involving business activities, rental arrangements, or intentional acts. Medical payments to others may cover small medical expenses regardless of fault, though limits here are low and are not a substitute for health insurance. There have been cases where neighbours attempted to claim injuries unrelated to the property in question, requiring the insurer to investigate whether the event actually occurred on the insured premises.

Various exclusions apply depending on the type of loss. Water damage caused by flooding from external bodies of water is typically excluded, even if the homeowner believes wind driven rain caused the problem. Earth movement such as earthquakes, landslides, or subsidence is also excluded unless additional coverage was purchased. Damage caused by neglect, wear and tear, mold, insects, animals, or gradual deterioration is not covered. Utility service failure, ordinance or law upgrades, and government action may also limit the insurer’s responsibility. Policyholders sometimes assume the insurer covers all weather related damage, but exclusions for repeated leakage or long term dampness often lead to disagreements.

Conditions require that losses be reported promptly and that homeowners take steps to protect property from further damage. This might involve boarding up windows, moving belongings away from affected areas, or arranging temporary repairs. Failure to act may reduce the settlement amount. Proof of loss statements and inventories of damaged items are often required, and the insurer may request receipts or photographs. Settlement values depend on whether the policy pays replacement cost or actual cash value, though misunderstandings commonly occur when depreciation is applied to items the homeowner believed would be paid in full.

Cancellation and non renewal rules allow the insurer to stop coverage for reasons such as non payment, misrepresentation, or hazardous conditions at the property. Some homeowners ignore inspection notices or fail to repair risks such as damaged roofs or faulty wiring, resulting in non renewal at the next cycle. When coverage ends unexpectedly, homeowners sometimes assume their mortgage company will resolve the issue automatically, which is not the case. Gaps in insurance can cause complications with lenders and may expose the homeowner to significant risk.
