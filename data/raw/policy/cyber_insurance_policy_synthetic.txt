Synthetic Cyber Insurance Practice Document

(inspired by: Cyber Insurance Policy Form from At-Bay) )

The cyber insurance arranged for the insured organisation is intended to provide financial protection following a qualifying cyber incident, although the extent of that protection varies depending on the specific situation at the time the event occurred and on whether the insured complied with the operational security practices that were understood by the insurer when the cover first took effect. It is common for organisations to assume that any type of digital disruption is automatically included in the scope of protection, but the policy wording usually distinguishes between malicious attacks, accidental system failures, and situations where employees or contractors contributed to the problem through negligence or improper handling of information. The insurer typically relies on records of network configuration, monitoring systems, and internal logs at the time an incident is reported, which sometimes leads to delays if such records were incomplete or maintained inconsistently across departments.

The amount of financial support available after a cyber event often depends on how the policyholder presented its risk profile when coverage was arranged. Details such as the number of employees with access to sensitive data, the presence or absence of multi factor authentication, and whether the organisation used outdated software all influence both the pricing and the limits that apply. In some years the organisation may have implemented improvements to its technology, such as encryption upgrades or new access control systems, but if these improvements were not notified to the insurer they may not be reflected in the applicable terms. The definitions of critical assets, confidential information, or computer systems can differ between editions of the contract, and these differences sometimes create confusion during the claims assessment process.

Payment of certain costs, such as ransom demands, forensic investigations, or business income loss, requires the insurer to first confirm that the event qualifies as a cyber incident under the policy. Some events appear to involve system malfunction but are later determined to have been caused by human error, and whether this is covered varies depending on the interpretation of accidental failure. There have also been cases where an employee clicked on a malicious link but the resulting damage did not meet the policy’s threshold for a covered attack because the malware did not propagate beyond the user’s device. Losses arising from social engineering attempts may require evidence that the insured followed established verification procedures before funds were transferred, and failure to follow such procedures sometimes limits or eliminates coverage.

The policyholder is normally required to report a cyber incident as soon as reasonably possible, but this can be complicated when the incident is only discovered after a period of undetected intrusion. Some organisations uncover breaches months after the first unauthorised access occurred, and disputes may arise over when the event is considered to have begun. Notification must typically include an account of steps taken to isolate affected systems, identify compromised data, and prevent further spread of the incident. The insurer may request copies of server logs, email header information, or results of internal investigations, and in some cases external forensic specialists are appointed to assist in determining the cause and scope of the problem. If these specialists uncover evidence that suggests deliberate policy violations, such as disabled firewalls or unapproved remote access tools, the insurer may limit or deny coverage.

Certain exclusions apply to cyber insurance even though they are not always well understood by organisations purchasing this type of cover. Losses caused by acts of war, state sponsored attacks, or widespread internet outages may fall outside the scope of cover depending on how broadly or narrowly such events are defined. Incidents involving the loss of physical devices, such as laptops left unattended in public places, may be covered only if the device contained encrypted data, although some policies treat such situations differently depending on the year the coverage was issued. Claims involving regulatory fines or penalties depend heavily on local law and on whether the insurer is permitted to indemnify such amounts. There have been instances where organisations believed reputational harm was covered, yet discovered that the policy only reimbursed specific crisis management costs.

The organisation is responsible for maintaining proper cyber hygiene which includes patching of software, restricting user access, and monitoring its systems for suspicious activity. If an incident occurs during a period when patches were significantly overdue or administrative passwords had not been changed for an extended time, the insurer may argue that the insured failed to exercise reasonable care. Employees must be trained on how to recognise suspicious messages and verify requests for sensitive information, and training records can influence how the insurer evaluates a social engineering claim. Larger organisations may have complex networks with varying security standards across teams, and the insurer will often rely on the weakest protected area when assessing overall exposure.

When a covered cyber incident causes business interruption, the organisation may be entitled to reimbursement for lost revenue, additional expenses required to continue operations, or the cost of restoring corrupted data. The calculation of such losses can be difficult because it requires distinguishing between pre existing operational issues and those caused directly by the incident. Some interruptions last only hours while others affect operations for weeks, and determining the appropriate length of the indemnity period sometimes involves negotiation. The insurer may also consider whether the organisation took reasonable steps to minimise losses, such as switching to backup systems or rerouting services through unaffected infrastructure.

Many terms used throughout this document have informal rather than strict legal definitions. For example, computer system may refer to any device, server, or network component used by the organisation, although earlier versions of similar policies sometimes excluded personal devices even when used for work. Confidential information may include personal records, financial details, commercial data, or client information, but whether accidentally sending an email to the wrong recipient qualifies as a covered breach depends on specific wording that may not be included within this condensed text. A cyber incident may refer to unauthorised access, damage to software, or disruption of operations, but each edition of the contract may list these in a different order or include subtle variations.
