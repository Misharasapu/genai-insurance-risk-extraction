Different regions have their own interpretations of sustainability, and the level of documentation varies. The company has attempted to quantify environmental impacts, but the numbers are difficult to compare due to changing boundaries and assumptions. The company's operational risk is high due to inconsistent data collection, vague details on recycling, and estimated waste reduction. The lack of formal policy on waste reduction and inconsistent reporting on social issues also contribute to the risk.
